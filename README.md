# AMCIS - AMC Information System

## History
This is one of my projects in my early careers as a software developer in 2011. `AMC` is the initial of a health clinic that requested me to build their web information system. I came up with this prototype. The project was eventually terminated later that year, yet 
I maintained the rights over the source code and decided to release it.

The stack is jQuery for the front-end, the then-renowned CodeIgniter PHP framework for the backend, and MySQL for the database.
